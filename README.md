# backbone.ti

This is an example project for using backbone.js with Appcelerator Titanium.
This repository will be kept clean so it can be used as a template for new
projects.

To use it, you'll have to

```shell
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

as backbone.js and underscore.js are submoduled out.
